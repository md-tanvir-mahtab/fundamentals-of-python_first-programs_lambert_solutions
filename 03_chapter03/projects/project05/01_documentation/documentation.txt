================================== Problem =============================================
A local biologist needs a program to predict population growth. The inputs
would be the initial number of organisms, the rate of growth (a real number
greater than 0), the number of hours it takes to achieve this rate, and a number
of hours during which the population grows. For example, one might start with a
population of 500 organisms, a growth rate of 2, and a growth period to achieve
this rate of 6 hours. Assuming that none of the organisms die, this would imply
that this population would double in size every 6 hours. Thus, after allowing
6 hours for growth, we would have 1000 organisms, and after 12 hours, we would
have 2000 organisms. Write a program that takes these inputs and displays a pre-
diction of the total population.

================================= Analysis =============================================
Let,
Initial population = population
Growth rate = growth_rate
Growth period = growth_period
Total time = total_time

The number of full growth times can be calculated by the following formula (Note: Here 
the division is an integer division).

full_growth_times = total_time // growth_period

The population after each of the full growth times can be calculated by the following
formula.

population = population * growth_rate

The partial growth time can be calculated by the following formula (Note: Here, % indi-
cates the modulo operator).

partial_growth_time = total_time % growth_period

The population at partial_growth_time can ba calculated by the following expression.
(Note: Here the "population in the expression is the population after full growth time")

population * (partial_growth_time / growth_period)

Finally, the final population can be found by adding the population after full growth 
times with the population at partial growth time.

================================= Design ===============================================
Based on the formulas discussed in the analysis phase we can design a function to cal-
culate the final population. The pseudocode of the function can be expressed as follows.

FUNCTION calculate_final_population(INT population, FLOAT growth_rate, FLOAT growth_period, FLOAT total_time)
    // Compute the number of full growth times
    // Here "//" indicates an integer division
    SET full_growth_times to total_time // growth_period

    // Compute population after full growth times
    WHILE full_growth_times GREATER THAN 0
        SET population to population * growth_rate
        SET full_growth_times to full_growth_times - 1
    END WHILE

    // Compute partial growth time
    // Here "%" is the modulo operator
    SET partial_growth_time to total_time % growth_period

    // Compute population at partial growth time
    SET partial_population to population * (partial_growth_time / growth_period)

    // Return the final population
    RETURN population + partial_population
    
END FUNCTION

Now, we would like to design a main function from which the calculate_final_population 
function will be called. The pseudocode of the main function is as follows.

FUNCTION main()
    // Take inputs
    READ initial population as initial_population
    READ growth rate as growth_rate
    READ growth period as growth_period
    READ total time as total_time

    // Call the function to calculate
    // the final populatin
    CALL calculate_final_population with initial_population, growth_rate, growth_period, total_time RETURNING final_population

    // Display the final populatin
    PRINT "The final population will be", final_population
END FUNCTION

Finally, there would be an execution point of the program as follows.

CALL main
