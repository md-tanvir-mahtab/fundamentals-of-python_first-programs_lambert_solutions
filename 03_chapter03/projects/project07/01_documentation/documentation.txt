================================== Problem =============================================
Teachers in most school districts are paid on a schedule that provides a salary
based on their number of years of teaching experience. For example, a beginning
teacher in the Lexington School District might be paid $30,000 the first year. For
each year of experience after this first year, up to 10 years, the teacher receives a
2% increase over the preceding value. Write a program that displays a salary sched-
ule, in tabular format, for teachers in a school district. The inputs are the starting
salary, the percentage increase, and the number of years in the schedule. Each row
in the schedule should contain the year number and the salary for that year.

================================== Analysis ============================================
Here, for each year (from after the first year) the salary should be calculated by the
following formula.

Salary = Salary of the previous year + salary of the previous year * Percentage increase

We have to implement this formula in our program.

================================== Design ==============================================
We can design a function to calculate the salary for each of the given years and display
the results in a tabular format. The pseudocode of the function can be expressed as 
follows.

FUNCTION calculate_salary(FLOAT salary, FLOAT percentage_increase, INT years)
    // Display the header row of the table
    // Make each column right-aligned
    PRINT "Year", "Salary"

    // Calculate and display salaries
    FOR year in 1 to years + 1
        // Make each column right-aligned
        PRINT year, salary

        // Calculate salary for the next year
        SET salary to salary + salary * percentage_increase
    END FOR
END FUNCTION

Now, we would like to design a main function from which the calculate_salary function 
will be called. The pseudocode of the main function is as follows.

FUNCTION main()
    // Take inputs
    READ the starting salary as starting_salary
    READ the percentage increase as percentage_increase
    // Convert percentage to decimal
    SET percentage_increase to percentage_increase / 100
    READ the number of years as years

    // Call the function to calculate
    // and display salaries
    CALL calculate_salary with starting_salary, percentage_increase, years
END FUNCTION

Finally, there would be an execution point of the program as follows.

CALL main
