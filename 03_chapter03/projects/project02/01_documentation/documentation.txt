================================= Problem ==============================================
Write a program that accepts the lengths of three sides of a triangle as inputs.
The program output should indicate whether or not the triangle is a right tri-
angle. Recall from the Pythagorean theorem that in a right triangle, the square of
one side equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

================================= Analysis =============================================
In order to check if a triangle is a right triangle, by using Pythagorean theorem, we 
need to specify the possible hypotenuse (i.e. the longest side) of the triangle. Since,
according to the Pythagorean theorem,

(hypotenuse)^2 = (one adjacent side)^2 + (another adjacent side)^2

Therefore, after taking the inpts first we have to specify the possible hypotenuse.
Then we have to check if the above Pythagorean formula is true for the given inputs.
If the formula turns to be true, the triangle is a right triangle, otherwise not.

================================ Design ================================================
We can design a function to check if a triangle is a right triangle. The pseudocode of 
the function can be expressed as follows.

FUNCTION is_right_triangle(FLOAT side_a, FLOAT side_b, FLOAT side_c)
    // Specify the hypotenuse (longest side)
    IF side_a GREATER THAN side_b
        IF side_a GREATER THAN side_c
            SET hypotenuse to side_a
        ELSE
            SET hypotenuse to side_c
        END IF
    ELSE
        IF side_b GREATER THAN side_c
            SET hypotenuse to side_b
        ELSE
            SET hypotenuse to side_c
        END IF
    END IF

    // Seperate the lengths of the adjacent sides
    // from the possible hypotenuse (i.e. take a list/collection
    // of the lengths of the sides excluding the one which
    // equals to the possibe hypotenuse)
    SET sides_list to the list of side_a, side_b, side_c
    REMOVE hypotenuse from sides_list
    SET adjacent_sides to sides_list

    // Check if the Pythagorean formula holds true
    // for the given inputs and reurns Boolean type
    // True or False based on it
    IF (hypotenuse)^2 EQUAL TO (adjacent_sides[0])^2 + (adjacent_sides[1])^2
        RETURN TRUE
    ELSE
        RETURN FALSE
    END IF
END FUNCTION

Now, we would like to design a main function from which the is_right_triangle
function will be called. The pseudocode of the main function is as follows.

FUNCTION main()
    // Take the lengths of the sides of the triangle
    // as inpts (The inputs should be floating-point numbers)
    READ the length of one side of the triangle as side_a
    READ the length of another side as side_b
    READ the length of the remaining side as side_c
    
    // Call the function to check
    // if the triangle is a right triangle
    CALL is_right_triangle with side_a, side_b, side_c RETURNING triangle_status

    // Display if the triangle is a right triangle
    IF triangle_status EQUAL TO TRUE
        PRINT "The triangle is a right triangle."
    ELSE
        PRINT "The triangle is not a right triangle."
    END IF
END FUNCTION

Finally, there would be an execution point of the program as follows.

CALL main
