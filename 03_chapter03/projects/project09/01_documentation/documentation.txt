Purpose: This file contains a brief documentation of the project.

==================================== Problem ===========================================
Write a program that receives a series of numbers from the user and allows the
user to press the enter key to indicate that he or she is finished providing inputs.
After the user presses the enter key, the program should print the sum of the
numbers and their average.

==================================== Analysis and Design ===============================
We can design a function to compute the sum and average of the given series of numbers.
The pseudocode of the function can be expressed as follows.

FUNCTION sum_and_average()
    // Declare a variable to count
    // the input numbers
    SET count to 0

    // Declare a variable to
    // hold the sum of input numbers
    SET the_sum to 0

    // Declare a variable to
    // hold the average of input numbers
    SET the_average to 0

    // Take inputs and
    // compute the sum and average
    WHILE TRUE
        READ the input as response PROMPTING WITH "Enter a number or press the Enter/Return key to get the results: "
        
        // Pressing only the Enter/Return key
        // is equivalent to inputting an empty string
        IF response EQUAL TO ""
            BREAK
        ELSE
            // Update the count of the number
            SET count to count + 1

            // Convert the response to a
            // floating-point number
            SET number to FLOAT(response)
            
            // Update the sum and average
            SET the_sum to the_sum + number
            SET the_average to the_sum / count
        END IF
    END WHILE

    // Display the sum and average
    PRINT "The sum is:", the_sum
    PRINT "The average is:", the_average
END FUNCTION

Now, we would like to design a main function from which the sum_and_average function will
be called. The pseudocode of the main function is as follows.

FUNCTION main()
    // Call the function to
    // take inputs, compute the sum and average,
    // and display the results
    CALL sum_and_average
END FUNCTION

Finally, there would be an execution point of the program as follows.

CALL main
