Purpose: This file contains a brief documentation of the project.

================================== Problem =============================================
The credit plan at TidBit Computer Store specifies a 10% down payment and
an annual interest rate of 12%. Monthly payments are 5% of the listed purchase
price, minus the down payment. Write a program that takes the purchase price
as input. The program should display a table, with appropriate headers, of a pay-
ment schedule for the lifetime of the loan. Each row of the table should contain
the following items:
    • the month number (beginning with 1)
    • the current total balance owed
    • the interest owed for that month
    • the amount of principal owed for that month
    • the payment for that month
    • the balance remaining after payment
The amount of interest for a month is equal to balance * rate / 12. The amount of
principal for a month is equal to the monthly payment minus the interest owed.

================================== Analysis ============================================
Here,
Down payment = Purchase price * 0.1
Monthly interest = Current balance * 0.12 / 12
Monthly payment = (Purchase price - Down payment) * 0.05
Monthly principal = Monthly payment - Monthly interest
Remaining balance = Current balance - Monthly principal

We have to implement these formulas in our program.

================================== Design ==============================================
We can design a function to compute and display different attributes of the credit
status. The pseudocode of the function can be expressed as follows.

FUNCTION credit_status(FLOAT purchase_price)
    // Specify initial value
    // of the remaining balance
    SET remaining_balance to purchase_price

    // Declare a variable
    // to hold the number of month
    SET month to 0

    // Display the header row of the table
    // Each column should be right-justified
    PRINT "Month", "Current Balance", "Monthly Interest", "Monthly Payment", "Monthly Principal", "Remaining Balance"
    
    // Compute and display different
    // attributes of the credit status
    WHILE remaining_balance GREATER THAN 0.0
        // Update the month
        SET month to month + 1

        // Update the current balance
        SET current_balance to remaining_balance

        // Compute monthly interest
        COMPUTE monthly_interest as current_balance * 0.12 / 12

        // Compute down payment
        COMPUTE down_payment as purchase_price * 0.1

        // Compute monthly payment
        COMPUTE monthly_payment as (purchase_price - down_payment) * 0.05

        // Compute monthly principal
        COMPUTE monthly_principal as monthly_payment - monthly_interest

        // Update remaining balance
        SET remaining_balance to current_balance - monthly_principal

        // Display the attributes
        // Each column should be right-justified
        PRINT month, current_balance, monthly_interest, monthly_payment, monthly_principal, remaining_balance
    END WHILE
END FUNCTION

Now we would like to design a main function from which the credit_status function will be
called. The pseudocode of the main function is as follows.

FUNCTION main()
    // Take input
    // The purchase price should be taken
    // as a floating-point number
    READ the purchase price as purchase_price PROMPTING WITH "Enter the purchase price: "

    // Call the function to compute
    // and display different attributes
    // of the credit status
    CALL credit_status WITH purchase_price
END FUNCTION

Finally, there would be an execution point of the program as follows.

CALL main
