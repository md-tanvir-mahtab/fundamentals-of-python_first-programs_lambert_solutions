=============================== Testing Principle ==================================
When testing a program that contains a loop, we should focus first on the input
that determines the number of iterations. In our program, this value is the number
of years. We enter a value that yields the smallest possible number of iterations,
then increase this number by 1, then use a slightly larger number, such as 5, and
finally we use a number close to the maximum expected, such as 50 (in our problem
domain, probably the largest realistic period of an investment). The values of the
other inputs, such as the investment amount and the rate in our program, should
be reasonably small and stay fixed for this phase of the testing. If the program pro-
duces correct outputs for all of these inputs, we can be confident that the loop is
working correctly.
In the next phase of testing, we examine the effects of the other inputs on the
results, including their format. We know that the other two inputs to our programs,
the investment and the rate, already produce correct results for small values. A rea-
sonable strategy might be to test a large investment amount with the smallest and
largest number of years and a small rate, and then with the largest number of years
and the largest reasonable rate. Following table organizes these sets of test data for 
the program.

Investment      Years       Rate
    100.00          1          5
    100.00          2          5
    100.00          5          5
    100.00         50          5
  10000.00          1          5
  10000.00         50          5
  10000.00         50         20
