Purpose: This file contains a brief overview of the testing principle for the project.

================================== Testing Principle ===================================
The valid inputs to this program are positive integers and floating-point numbers.
The display of Pythonâ€™s own most accurate estimate of the square root provides
a benchmark for assessing the correctness of our own algorithm. We should at
least provide a couple of perfect squares, such as 4 and 9, as well as numbers
whose square roots are inexact, such as 2 and 3. A number between 1 and 0,
such as .25, should also be included. Because the accuracy of our algorithm
also depends on the size of the tolerance, we might alter this value during testing
as well.
