Question:
    Describe the purpose of the break statement and the type of problem for which it is
    well suited.

Answer:
    The purpose of the break statement is to terminate a loop. Typically we use the
    break statement to terminate the loop when some expected condition is met. For
    example, we can use a "while" loop to take an input and as soon as we can make
    sure that the input is valid we can terminate the loop using the break statement.
