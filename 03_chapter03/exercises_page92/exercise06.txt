Question:
    What happens when the programmer forgets to update the loop control variable in
    a while loop?

Answer:
    If a programmer forgets to update the loop control variable in a "while" loop, the 
    continuation condition of the loop always remains "True". Consequently, the loop
    turns to be an infinite loop.
