=========================== Problem ================================================
Five Star Retro Video rents VHS tapes and DVDs to the same connoisseurs who
like to buy LP record albums. The store rents new videos for $3.00 a night, and
oldies for $2.00 a night. Write a program that the clerks at Five Star Retro Video
can use to calculate the total charge for a customerâ€™s video rentals. The program
should prompt the user for the number of each type of video and output the total
cost.

=========================== Analysis ===============================================
Here, the total rental cost can be calculated using the following formula.

Total rental cost = Rental cost for each new video * number of new videos +
                    Rental cost for each oldie video * number of oldie videos

We have to implement this formula in our code.

=========================== Design =================================================
The pseudocode of the function for calculating the total rental cost can be expressed
as follows.

FUNCTION calculate_rental_cost(INTEGER num_new_video, INTEGER num_oldie_video)
    # Define rental costs for each type of video as constant
    CONSTANT new_video_cost = 3.00
    CONSTANT oldie_video_cost = 2.00

    # Calculate total rental cost
    total_cost = new_video_cost * num_new_video + oldie_video_cost * num_oldie_video

    # Return the total cost
    RETURN total_cost
END FUNCTION
