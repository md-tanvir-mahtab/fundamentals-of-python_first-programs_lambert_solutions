================================ Problem =======================================
You can calculate the surface area of a cube if you know the length of an edge.
Write a program that takes the length of an edge (an integer) as input and prints
the cubeâ€™s surface area as output.

================================ Analysis ======================================
We can get the surface area of a cube by squaring the length of an edge of the cube.
That means, the surface area of a cube = (The length of an edge)^2

We have to implement this formula in our code.

================================ Design =========================================
The pseudocode of the function for calulating the surface area of a cube can be 
expressed as follows.

FUNCTION calculate_area(edge_length)
    # Return the surface area i.e. the squred value of the length of the edge
    RETURN (edge_length)^2
END FUNCTION
